# Python-Course-openHPI-2025
This repository is dedicated to my progress through the Python Course on openHPI.

The course is designed to provide a solid introduction to Python for new developers and to give experienced programmers a fresh perspective through engaging questions and exciting hands-on exercises.
It runs for six weeks and concludes with a final exam.

## Purpose

I am taking this course to strengthen my fundamental Python skills.
It includes numerous videos, quizzes, and practical coding exercises, helping participants to deepen their understanding of the language and apply it effectively.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the exercises and code solutions I have written while completing the course.
Each file reflects what I learned in a specific module or topic covered during the program.

## Future Updates

After successfully completing the course,
I will upload my certificate of completion (diploma) to this repository.
