# Python-Course-openHPI-2025

This repository documents my progress through the [Python Course on openHPI](https://open.hpi.de/courses/python2025)

The course is designed to give a solid foundation in Python programming for beginners while also providing a fresh and engaging perspective for experienced developers.
It runs over six weeks and concludes with a final exam and certificate.

## Purpose

I am taking this course to strengthen my core Python skills and deepen my understanding of the language through:

Clear and structured video lectures

Interactive quizzes and coding exercises

Practical programming challenges

Each topic builds on the previous one, helping to develop both logical thinking and problem-solving abilities in Python.

## About This Repository

This repository contains:

My completed exercises and solutions for each week’s topics

Small code projects demonstrating key Python concepts

Occasional notes or explanations that summarize what I learned

Each file corresponds to a specific week or module in the course.

## My Work – Screenshots

I will update this section after completing the course to include code samples, outputs, and screenshots from the openHPI platform.

## Future Updates

After successfully completing the course:

I will upload my official openHPI certificate (diploma)

Add a short summary of key takeaways from all six weeks
